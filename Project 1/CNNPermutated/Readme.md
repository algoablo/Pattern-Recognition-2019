# Convolutional Neural Network
## Task 2d (PermutatedMNIST)
-An implementation of a deep convolutional neural network
-Done in Python.

         #The purpose of this project was to understand the full architecture of a conv net and to visually break down what's going on while training to recognize images. 

#DONE:
Setting up:
 set up the architecutre by Creating a linear stack of layers, specifying the number of layers (convolutional, pooling, fully connected (FC) and final (classify) layer)
 make sure to use an FC layer as your last layer before classifying
 Conv2D: This is the convolution layer
 MaxPooling2D: This function performs max pooling
 SGD: Stochastic Gradient Descent, this is the optimizer
 make sure you see the pattern changes in the weight kernels after each batch update




#Usage
The program has done in Jupyter notebook.

#Results
You can see the output of the running code in 
CNNwithpermutatedmnist.ipynb.
