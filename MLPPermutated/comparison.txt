MLP (MNIST):
Best accuracy: 0.9208 
Iterations: 800   Neurons: 100  Learning rate: 0.02
MLP (PermutatedMNIST):
Best accuracy: 0.6743 
Iterations: 1000   Neurons: 100  Learning rate: 0.02


Why MLP has higher accuracy than PMLP:
This is due to the Best accuracy in MLP Permutated MNIST which comes from 
the more challenging sequence of the pictures which are permuted at random.
